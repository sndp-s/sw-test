to run this project, navigate to `./app`
then,
run the command `yarn install`
run the command `yarn start`

P.S. If I had to do this all over again, I would use `flux` state management lib or something similar. That would make my life earlier and code clean.
There could be some issues here and there but this is all I am able to do with a full time job.
Thank you.
